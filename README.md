# Smart Agents: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Management

## Overview
This research-oriented project implements a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system to manage dynamic resources efficiently and fairly.  
The system simulates 2–5 intelligent agents operating in a simplified environment (e.g., cloud servers, energy grids, or logistics) and evaluates strategies for cooperation, adaptability, and fairness.

## Key Features
- Multi-Agent Cooperation:** Agents communicate and coordinate to optimize resource utilization.  
- Adaptive Strategies: Agents dynamically adjust actions based on changing environment conditions.  
- Novel Reward Shaping: Reward functions are designed to encourage efficiency and fairness among all agents.  
- Algorithm Variety: Implements baseline and advanced RL algorithms including:
  - Q-Learning (tabular, baseline)
  - Deep Q-Network (DQN)
  - Actor-Critic
  - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Performance Analysis: Metrics include total reward, resource utilization, latency, and fairness.  
- Visualization: Graphs, heatmaps, and plots help interpret agent behavior and system performance.

## Methodology
1. Environment Setup
   - Define state space (what agents observe)
   - Define action space (possible decisions)
   - Define reward function (encouraging efficiency and fairness)
   - Use OpenAI Gym or PettingZoo to simulate dynamic resources

2. Baseline Implementation
   - Start with Q-Learning for 2–3 agents
   - Collect baseline metrics: total reward, fairness, latency  

3. Advanced Algorithms
   - Implement DQN, Actor-Critic, and PPO
   - Introduce communication and cooperation strategies
   - Test in larger environments (3–5 agents)

4. Experiments & Analysis
   - Run multiple simulations with varying parameters
   - Compare baseline vs advanced algorithms
   - Visualize metrics to evaluate agent performance and system efficiency
